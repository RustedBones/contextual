- user-defined string interpolators
- introduce compile-time failures on invalid values, such as `url"htpt://example.com"`
- compile-time behavior can be defined on _literal_ parts of a string
- runtime behavior can be defined on literal and interpolated parts of a string
- types of interpolated values can be context-dependent
- simple type-based parsing for interpolated values
- shorthand `Verifier` class for defining runtime and compiletime behavior together
