# Change log

## Version 1.1.0

- Support for simple verifiers where the same method implements both the
  compile-time check and the runtime implementation.

## Version 1.0.2

- Allow refinement of the interpolator return type, to help IDEs which are
  not able to run whitebox macros.

## Version 1.0.1

- Prevent inference of a too-narrow return type from type embeddings, causing
  implicit embeddings not to be found.

## Version 1.0.0

- First release version
